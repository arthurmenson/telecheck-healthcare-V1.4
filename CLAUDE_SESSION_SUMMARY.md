## üö® Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. Platform Architecture Mismatch
**Problem**: Docker images built on ARM64 (Apple Silicon) couldn't run on ECS Fargate (AMD64)
**Solution**: Rebuilt all images with `--platform linux/amd64` flag

### 2. AWS Secrets Manager Integration
**Problem**: ECS tasks failing due to missing secret values
**Solution**: Populated all required secrets with proper JSON structure

### 3. Terraform Configuration Errors
**Problems**:
- S3 backend configuration syntax
- ECS service configuration conflicts
- Target group naming length limits
- HTTPS listener without SSL certificate

**Solutions**:
- Commented out S3 backend for local state
- Simplified ECS service configuration
- Implemented short names for target groups
- Disabled HTTPS, used HTTP-only for staging

### 4. Service Routing Configuration
**Problem**: ALB routing rules needed proper path patterns
**Solution**: Configured specific path patterns for each service:
- Frontend: `/`, `/static/*`, `/assets/*`
- Auth: `/api/auth/*`, `/api/security/*`
- AI/ML: `/api/ai/*`, `/api/ml/*`
- Core: `/api/patients/*`, `/api/appointments/*`, `/api/providers/*`
- Analytics: `/api/analytics/*`, `/api/reports/*`
- PMS: `/api/integrations/*`, `/api/fhir/*`

## üí° Key Learnings & Best Practices

### Architecture Decisions
1. **ECS Fargate over EKS**: Chosen for simplicity and cost-effectiveness
2. **Microservices Architecture**: Each service independently deployable
3. **Blue-Green Deployments**: Zero-downtime updates
4. **Infrastructure as Code**: Everything defined in Terraform
5. **Security by Default**: Secrets management, non-root containers, VPC isolation

### Technical Insights
1. **Platform Compatibility**: Always build for target architecture (AMD64 for ECS Fargate)
2. **Secret Management**: Use AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive data
3. **Service Discovery**: ALB path-based routing for microservices
4. **Health Checks**: Essential for reliable deployments
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Automate everything for consistency

### Operational Excellence
1. **Monitoring**: CloudWatch for observability
2. **Logging**: Centralized logging with AWS CloudWatch Logs
3. **Automation**: GitHub Actions for consistent deployments
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for maintenance
5. **Security**: Rotating credentials and least-privilege access
