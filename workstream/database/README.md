# Database Workstream

**Branch**: `database`
**Focus**: PostgreSQL schema, migrations, ORM setup

## <¯ Mission

Establish type-safe, performant PostgreSQL database layer with proper migrations, schemas, and query optimization to replace the prototype's loose database handling.

## =Ë Critical Issues to Fix from Prototype

- **No visible schema definitions or migrations**
- **SQLite fallback creates environment inconsistency**
- **No type-safe database access layer**
- **Missing proper indexing and optimization**
- **Database abstraction layer is overly complex**

##  Success Criteria

### Schema & Types
- [ ] 100% schema coverage with TypeScript types
- [ ] All tables have proper foreign key relationships
- [ ] Comprehensive indexing strategy implemented
- [ ] Complete audit trail tables for HIPAA compliance

### Performance
- [ ] <50ms average query response time
- [ ] Query optimization with EXPLAIN ANALYZE
- [ ] Connection pooling with proper limits
- [ ] Database monitoring and alerting

### Data Integrity
- [ ] Zero data integrity issues in testing
- [ ] Complete migration rollback capability
- [ ] Comprehensive constraint validation
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested

## =€ Getting Started

```bash
# Switch to database workstream
cd workstream/database

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Setup local PostgreSQL
docker-compose up postgres

# Run migrations
pnpm run migrate

# Seed test data
pnpm run seed
```
