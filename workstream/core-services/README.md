# Core Services Workstream

**Branch**: `core-services`
**Focus**: Patient, Lab, Medication, Appointment services

## <¯ Mission

Build clean microservice APIs for core healthcare functionality with proper validation, business logic, and clear service boundaries.

## =Ë Critical Issues to Fix from Prototype

- **Monolithic route structure with poor separation**
- **No clear service boundaries or contracts**
- **Over-engineered features without clear business benefit**
- **Poor error handling and validation patterns**
- **Business logic mixed with route handlers**

##  Success Criteria

### API Design
- [ ] OpenAPI-first design with complete documentation
- [ ] Clear service boundaries and contracts
- [ ] Consistent error handling across all endpoints
- [ ] Proper HTTP status codes and response formats

### Performance
- [ ] <100ms API response times (95th percentile)
- [ ] Efficient database queries with proper caching
- [ ] Load testing validation for concurrent users
- [ ] Resource optimization and memory management

### Business Logic
- [ ] Comprehensive input validation with Zod schemas
- [ ] Healthcare domain rules properly implemented
- [ ] Audit logging for all critical operations
- [ ] Transaction management for data consistency

### Service Architecture
- [ ] Clear microservice boundaries
- [ ] Event-driven communication between services
- [ ] Independent deployability preparation
- [ ] Service-to-service authentication

## =€ Getting Started

```bash
# Switch to core-services workstream
cd workstream/core-services
