# Integrations Workstream

**Branch**: `integrations`
**Focus**: FHIR, messaging, wearables, external APIs

## <¯ Mission

Create reliable integrations with external systems (FHIR, messaging, wearables) with proper error handling, circuit breakers, and compliance standards.

## =Ë Critical Issues to Fix from Prototype

- **Multiple messaging providers without clear strategy**
- **FHIR 'preparation' without actual implementation**
- **No visible circuit breaker or retry patterns**
- **Integration complexity without clear business benefit**
- **Unreliable external API handling**

##  Success Criteria

### FHIR Compliance
- [ ] 100% HL7 FHIR R4 standard compliance
- [ ] Bidirectional data exchange with EHR systems
- [ ] Proper resource mapping and validation
- [ ] FHIR server certification readiness

### Messaging Reliability
- [ ] 99.9% message delivery success rate
- [ ] Unified messaging interface (Telnyx/Twilio)
- [ ] Message queue with retry and dead letter handling
- [ ] Delivery confirmation and status tracking

### Wearable Integration
- [ ] Secure OAuth integration with device APIs
- [ ] Real-time data synchronization
- [ ] Data validation and normalization
- [ ] Device failure handling and recovery

### External API Management
- [ ] Circuit breaker patterns for all external calls
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and logging
- [ ] Rate limiting and backoff strategies
- [ ] API health monitoring and alerting

## =€ Getting Started

```bash
# Switch to integrations workstream
cd workstream/integrations

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Setup FHIR server
docker-compose up fhir-server

# Test integrations
pnpm run test:integrations

# Start development server
pnpm run dev
```
