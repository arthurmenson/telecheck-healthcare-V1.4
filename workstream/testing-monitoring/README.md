# Testing & Monitoring Workstream

**Branch**: `testing-monitoring`
**Focus**: Comprehensive testing, monitoring, observability

## <¯ Mission

Establish comprehensive testing framework and production monitoring with performance benchmarks, replacing the prototype's shallow testing approach.

## =Ë Critical Issues to Fix from Prototype

- **Shallow testing with only 30 basic test cases**
- **No performance or load testing infrastructure**
- **Missing production monitoring and observability**
- **No error tracking or alerting systems**
- **Limited test coverage validation**

##  Success Criteria

### Test Coverage
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage across all services
- [ ] Unit, integration, and E2E test suites
- [ ] Performance and load testing framework
- [ ] Security and vulnerability testing

### Test Performance
- [ ] <2 minute complete test suite execution
- [ ] Parallel test execution for efficiency
- [ ] Automated test result reporting
- [ ] Continuous integration test gates

### Production Monitoring
- [ ] 24/7 system monitoring with <5 minute alerting
- [ ] Application performance monitoring (APM)
- [ ] Real-time error tracking and reporting
- [ ] Business metrics and KPI dashboards

### Observability
- [ ] Structured logging with correlation IDs
- [ ] Distributed tracing across services
- [ ] Health check endpoints for all services
- [ ] Performance benchmarking and regression detection

## =€ Getting Started

```bash
# Switch to testing-monitoring workstream
cd workstream/testing-monitoring

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Setup monitoring stack
docker-compose up prometheus grafana

# Run complete test suite
pnpm run test:all

# Start monitoring dashboard
pnpm run monitor:dev
```

## =' Key Tasks

### Week 1-2: Foundation
- [ ] Setup Jest/Vitest testing framework
- [ ] Create E2E testing pipeline with Playwright
- [ ] Implement Prometheus monitoring setup
- [ ] Setup Grafana dashboards and alerting

### Week 3-4: Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] Build load testing framework with k6
- [ ] Security testing with OWASP ZAP
- [ ] Performance benchmarking suite
- [ ] Test data management and cleanup

### Week 5-6: Production Readiness
- [ ] Complete monitoring and alerting setup
- [ ] Error tracking and incident response
- [ ] Performance optimization based on monitoring
- [ ] Documentation and runbooks for operations
