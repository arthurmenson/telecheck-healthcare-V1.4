# Infrastructure Workstream

**Branch**: `infrastructure`
**Focus**: Build systems, TypeScript configuration, CI/CD, tooling

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission

Transform the prototype's loose TypeScript configuration into a production-grade development environment with strict typing, comprehensive linting, automated testing, and robust CI/CD pipeline.

## ðŸ“‹ Critical Issues to Fix

### 1. TypeScript Configuration Disaster
**Current Prototype State**:
```json
{
  "strict": false,
  "noUnusedLocals": false,
  "noImplicitAny": false
}
```

**Target Production State**:
```json
{
  "strict": true,
  "noUnusedLocals": true,
  "noImplicitAny": true,
  "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true,
  "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true
}
```

### 2. Missing Development Infrastructure
- No proper linting rules
- No automated code quality checks
- No security scanning
- No performance budgets
- No automated testing pipeline

## âœ… Success Criteria

### Type Safety
- [ ] Zero `any` types in production code
- [ ] 100% TypeScript strict mode compliance
- [ ] All external APIs properly typed
- [ ] Comprehensive error type definitions

### Code Quality
- [ ] ESLint score: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- [ ] Prettier: 100% formatted code
- [ ] No cyclomatic complexity > 10
- [ ] No duplicate code blocks

### Performance
- [ ] Build time < 60 seconds
- [ ] Type checking < 30 seconds
- [ ] Linting < 15 seconds
- [ ] Test suite < 2 minutes

### Security
- [ ] Zero high/critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Automated dependency scanning
- [ ] Container security scanning
- [ ] Secret detection in commits

### CI/CD
- [ ] Pipeline execution < 5 minutes
- [ ] Automated testing on every PR
- [ ] Security gates prevent merging
- [ ] Performance regression detection

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

```bash
# Switch to infrastructure workstream
cd workstream/infrastructure

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run type checking
pnpm run type-check

# Run linting
pnpm run lint

# Build for production
pnpm run build
```

## ðŸ”§ Key Tasks

### Week 1-2: Foundation
- [ ] Setup strict TypeScript configuration
- [ ] Configure ESLint with healthcare-specific rules
- [ ] Setup Prettier and code formatting
- [ ] Create Docker development environment

### Week 3-4: CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow setup
- [ ] Automated testing pipeline
- [ ] Security vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Performance regression testing

### Week 5-6: Quality Gates
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks with Husky
- [ ] Code coverage requirements
- [ ] Dependency security scanning
- [ ] Production build optimization
