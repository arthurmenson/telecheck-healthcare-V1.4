- **Healthcare-Specific Mocking**: Proper API client mocking for medical services
- **Safety-First Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for patient safety
- **Real TDD Example**: Complete medication service built using Red-Green-Refactor

### ‚úÖ Coverage Configuration

- **Healthcare Thresholds**: 95%+ for critical services, 100% for API client
- **Multiple Reporters**: Text, HTML, JSON, and LCOV formats
- **Comprehensive Exclusions**: Excludes UI components, examples, and configuration files
- **Watermark System**: Visual quality indicators

### ‚úÖ Developer Experience

- **Interactive Commands**: 8 different test/coverage commands available
- **Guided Workflows**: TDD workflow script with step-by-step guidance
- **Coverage Dashboard**: Real-time coverage monitoring with healthcare metrics
- **Documentation**: Complete guide with examples and best practices

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Commands

```bash
# Testing
npm run test                    # Run tests once
npm run test:watch             # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage          # Generate coverage
npm run test:tdd              # TDD mode (watch + coverage)

# Workflows
npm run tdd:workflow          # Guided TDD workflow
npm run coverage:dashboard    # Coverage quality dashboard

# Quality
npm run type-check            # TypeScript checking
npm run lint                  # Code linting
npm run format               # Code formatting
```

## üè• Healthcare-Specific Features

### Safety Standards
- **100% Coverage Required**: For patient data, medications, and authentication
- **Error Handling**: Safety-first approach when systems fail
- **Mock Data Safety**: No real patient data in tests
- **Audit Compliance**: Test coverage for regulatory requirements

### TDD Patterns
- **Drug Interaction Testing**: Critical safety feature examples
- **Medication Adherence**: Patient monitoring patterns
- **Allergy Checking**: Safety validation examples
- **Prescription Validation**: Data integrity testing

### Quality Assurance
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript configuration
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance testing patterns
- **Security**: Input validation and sanitization tests
- **Performance**: Coverage-guided optimization

## ü§ñ Subagent Integrations

### TDD Workflow Agent
- Location: `.claude/agents/tdd-workflow.md`
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle enforcement
- Healthcare-specific testing patterns
- Safety validation requirements

### Code Coverage Agent
- Location: `.claude/agents/code-coverage.md`
- Healthcare coverage standards
- Critical path monitoring
- Quality improvement recommendations

## üìà Current Metrics

- **Test Files**: 3 test suites
- **Total Tests**: 32 tests passing
- **Coverage**: Services at 26.81% (will improve with more tests)
- **Critical Services**: Medication service at 70.12% coverage
- **Quality Standards**: Healthcare-grade configuration active

## üîÑ TDD Workflow Example

The medication service demonstrates a complete TDD cycle:

1. **RED**: Failing tests for drug interaction checking
2. **GREEN**: Minimal implementation to pass tests
3. **REFACTOR**: Enhanced with safety features and error handling

Key features tested:
- Drug interaction detection (Warfarin + Aspirin = MAJOR risk)
- Medication adherence tracking (80% threshold)
- Prescription validation (required fields, format checking)
- Allergy checking (drug family cross-references)

## üéØ Next Steps for Development

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix TypeScript Errors**: Address the existing codebase type issues
2. **Expand Test Coverage**: Add tests for critical healthcare modules
3. **Integration Testing**: Add end-to-end test scenarios
4. **Performance Testing**: Add load testing for API endpoints

### Healthcare Compliance
1. **HIPAA Testing**: Data encryption and access control tests
2. **FDA Validation**: Medical device software testing standards
3. **Audit Preparation**: Comprehensive test documentation
4. **Security Testing**: Penetration testing framework integration

### Team Adoption
1. **Training Sessions**: TDD workshop for healthcare developers
2. **Code Review Standards**: TDD compliance in pull requests
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Automated quality gates
4. **Monitoring**: Coverage trend tracking and alerts
