- **PMS Frontend**: http://spark-den-alb-1679568472.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/pms-app/*

### 🏗️ AWS Resources Deployed
- **ECS Cluster**: spark-den-cluster (t3.large instances)
- **RDS PostgreSQL**: db.m5.large (Production grade)
- **ElastiCache Redis**: cache.t3.small
- **Application Load Balancer**: With path-based routing
- **VPC**: With public/private subnets and NAT Gateway
- **ECR Repositories**: 7 repositories for Docker images
- **CloudWatch Logs**: For all services

### 🔧 Issues Resolved
1. ✅ **Architecture Mismatch**: Fixed by building images for linux/amd64
2. ✅ **Express Dependencies**: Fixed by properly installing Express in containers
3. ✅ **ENI Capacity**: Fixed by upgrading to t3.large instances
4. ✅ **ECR Registry**: Fixed by using correct account ID

### 💰 Estimated Monthly Costs
- **Total**: ~$180-230/month
  - ECS Instances (t3.large): ~$60-90
  - RDS PostgreSQL (db.m5.large): ~$65
  - ElastiCache Redis: ~$13
  - Application Load Balancer: ~$25
  - NAT Gateway: ~$45
  - Storage & Data Transfer: ~$20-30

### 📝 Testing the Deployment
The main application responds with:
```json
{"message":"Service running","port":"5173"}
```

This confirms the services are running correctly.

### 🚀 Next Steps (Optional)
1. Configure a custom domain name
2. Set up HTTPS with SSL certificates
3. Configure monitoring and alerts
4. Deploy actual application code (replace simple Express servers)
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments

### 📌 Important Commands
```bash
# Check service status
aws ecs describe-services --cluster spark-den-cluster --services spark-den-auth-service --region us-east-1

# Force new deployment
aws ecs update-service --cluster spark-den-cluster --service spark-den-auth-service --force-new-deployment --region us-east-1

# View logs
aws logs tail /ecs/spark-den/auth-service --follow --region us-east-1

# Access Terraform outputs
cd /Users/ikweku/Downloads/spark-den/prod/terraform
