## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Team Leads
```bash
# View all workstreams
git worktree list

# Check workstream assignments
cat WORKSTREAM_ASSIGNMENTS.md

# Verify CI/CD setup
.github/workflows/ci.yml
```

### For Developers
```bash
# Choose your workstream
cd workstream/<your-workstream>

# Read the specific workstream README
cat README.md

# Start development
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

## 🏗️ Workstream Overview

### 1. **Infrastructure** (`infrastructure` branch)
**Owner**: Infrastructure Team
**Focus**: TypeScript strict mode, ESLint, CI/CD, Docker
**Key Fix**: Zero `any` types, proper build pipeline
**Timeline**: Week 1-6 (foundational)

### 2. **Database** (`database` branch)
**Owner**: Database Team
**Focus**: PostgreSQL schema, Drizzle ORM, migrations
**Key Fix**: Type-safe database, no SQLite fallbacks
**Timeline**: Week 1-6 (requires Infrastructure)

### 3. **Auth & Security** (`auth-security` branch)
**Owner**: Security Team
**Focus**: JWT refresh tokens, RBAC, security middleware
**Key Fix**: Enterprise-grade auth, proper rate limiting
**Timeline**: Week 1-6 (requires Infrastructure + Database)

### 4. **Core Services** (`core-services` branch)
**Owner**: Backend Team
**Focus**: Patient/Lab/Medication APIs, OpenAPI
**Key Fix**: Clean microservices, proper validation
**Timeline**: Week 1-6 (requires Infrastructure + Database + Auth)

### 5. **Integrations** (`integrations` branch)
**Owner**: Integration Team
**Focus**: FHIR R4, messaging, wearables, webhooks
**Key Fix**: Real FHIR implementation, reliable messaging
**Timeline**: Week 1-6 (requires Infrastructure + Core Services)

### 6. **Testing & Monitoring** (`testing-monitoring` branch)
**Owner**: QA/DevOps Team
**Focus**: 90% test coverage, monitoring, observability
**Key Fix**: Comprehensive testing, production monitoring
**Timeline**: Week 1-6 (requires all other workstreams)

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- Each workstream has its own branch to prevent conflicts
- Regular integration testing via CI/CD
- Merge to `main` only after quality gates pass

### Daily Process
1. **Morning**: Check workstream assignment and dependencies
2. **Development**: Work on assigned workstream branch
3. **Commits**: Push to workstream branch regularly
4. **Integration**: CI/CD runs tests across all workstreams
5. **Evening**: Review integration test results

### Quality Gates
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode compliance
- ✅ ESLint with zero errors/warnings
- ✅ 90%+ test coverage
- ✅ Security vulnerability scanning
- ✅ Performance benchmarks met

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Technical Excellence
- **Zero `any` types** in production code
- **<100ms API response times** (95th percentile)
- **90%+ test coverage** across all services
- **Zero security vulnerabilities** (SAST/DAST)

### Healthcare Compliance
- **HIPAA audit trail** implementation complete
- **HL7 FHIR R4** compliance validated
- **Data encryption** at rest and in transit
- **Access logging** for all operations

### Production Readiness
- **CI/CD pipeline** with quality gates
- **Docker containerization** with security scanning
- **Monitoring and alerting** (24/7)
- **Performance benchmarking** completed

## 🚨 Conflict Prevention

### File Ownership
Each workstream owns specific directories:
- **Infrastructure**: Root configs, CI/CD, Docker
- **Database**: Schema, migrations, database layer
- **Auth/Security**: Auth middleware, security configs
- **Core Services**: Business logic, API routes
- **Integrations**: External APIs, webhooks
- **Testing**: Test infrastructure, monitoring

### Shared Resources
- **Types**: `/shared/types/` - changes require team approval
- **Utils**: `/shared/utils/` - changes require team approval
- **Docs**: `/docs/` - collaborative documentation

## 📋 Next Steps

### Team Leads
1. **Assign developers** to workstreams based on expertise
2. **Review workstream READMEs** for detailed task breakdown
3. **Setup daily standups** for coordination
4. **Monitor CI/CD pipeline** for integration issues

### Developers
1. **Read your workstream README** thoroughly
2. **Setup development environment** (Node 20+, pnpm 8+)
3. **Start with Week 1-2 foundation tasks**
4. **Commit early and often** to your workstream branch

### Project Manager
1. **Track progress** via workstream completion metrics
2. **Coordinate dependencies** between workstreams
3. **Monitor quality gates** in CI/CD pipeline
4. **Plan integration milestones** for cross-workstream testing

## 🎉 Ready for Production-Grade Development!

This development environment addresses all critical issues from the prototype:

✅ **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Replacing loose configuration
✅ **Microservice Architecture**: Clear service boundaries
✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: 90%+ coverage requirement
✅ **Security Hardening**: Enterprise-grade implementation
✅ **Production Monitoring**: 24/7 observability
✅ **HIPAA Compliance**: Complete audit trail

**Timeline**: 3-4 months to production deployment
**Approach**: Test-driven, security-first, microservices
**Quality**: Production-grade healthcare software
