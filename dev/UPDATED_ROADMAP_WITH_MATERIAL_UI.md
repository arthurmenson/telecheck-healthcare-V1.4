# Updated Enterprise Roadmap - Material-UI PMS Portal Implementation

## Architecture Strategy Update

### Approach: Preserve Current EHR UI + New Material-UI PMS Portal

Instead of rebuilding everything, we'll take a strategic approach:

1. **Keep Current EHR UI**: Maintain existing clinical interface, only removing PMS-specific elements
2. **Build New PMS Portal**: Create entirely new Material-UI based practice management system
3. **Gradual Migration**: Move business functions from EHR to PMS portal over time
