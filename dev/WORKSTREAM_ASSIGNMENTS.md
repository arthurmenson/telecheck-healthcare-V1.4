## 🚨 Conflict Prevention Strategy

### File Ownership Matrix
| Area | Infrastructure | Database | Auth/Security | Core Services | Integrations | Testing | Frontend |
|------|----------------|----------|---------------|---------------|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Root configs** | ✅ Owner | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Database layer** | ❌ | ✅ Owner | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Auth middleware** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Owner | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Business logic** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Owner | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **External APIs** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Owner | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Test infrastructure** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Owner | ❌ |
| **Frontend UI** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Owner |

### Communication Protocol
1. **Daily Standup**: Each workstream reports progress and dependencies
2. **Interface Contracts**: Shared types in `/shared/types/` - changes require approval
3. **API Contracts**: OpenAPI specs owned by Core Services, consumed by others
4. **Database Schema**: Owned by Database team, changes require migration approval

### Merge Strategy
```bash
# 1. Each workstream develops on their branch
git checkout <workstream-branch>

# 2. Regular integration testing
git checkout main
git merge <workstream-branch> --no-ff

# 3. Resolve conflicts in integration branch first
git checkout integration
git merge main
git merge <all-workstream-branches>

# 4. Only merge to main after integration tests pass
```
