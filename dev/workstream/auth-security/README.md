# Auth & Security Workstream

**Branch**: `auth-security`
**Focus**: JWT implementation, RBAC, security middleware

## <¯ Mission

Implement enterprise-grade authentication and security with proper JWT handling, fine-grained RBAC, and comprehensive HIPAA compliance measures.

## =Ë Critical Issues to Fix from Prototype

- **Basic JWT without refresh token rotation**
- **Rate limiting too permissive (100 requests/15min)**
- **No visible comprehensive input sanitization**
- **Security implementation lacks defense-in-depth**
- **Missing proper session management**

##  Success Criteria

### Authentication
- [ ] JWT with secure refresh token rotation
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication support
- [ ] Session management with proper invalidation
- [ ] Account lockout and suspicious activity detection

### Authorization
- [ ] Fine-grained RBAC (Doctor/Admin/Nurse/Patient roles)
- [ ] Resource-level permission controls
- [ ] API endpoint authorization (100% coverage)
- [ ] Data access logging for audit compliance

### Security Hardening
- [ ] Adaptive rate limiting per endpoint/user
- [ ] Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- [ ] XSS, CSRF, and injection attack prevention
- [ ] Security headers and CORS configuration

### HIPAA Compliance
- [ ] Complete audit trail for all data access
- [ ] Data encryption at rest and in transit
- [ ] User access logging and monitoring
- [ ] Compliance reporting capabilities

## =€ Getting Started

```bash
# Switch to auth-security workstream
cd workstream/auth-security

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run security tests
pnpm run test:security

# Start development server
pnpm run dev
```
