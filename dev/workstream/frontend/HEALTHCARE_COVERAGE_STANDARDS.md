# Healthcare Coverage Standards & Compliance Guide

## 🏥 Overview

This document establishes the healthcare-grade test coverage standards for the Telecheck Frontend application. These standards are designed to meet regulatory requirements and ensure patient safety through comprehensive testing of all healthcare-related functionality.

## 📊 Coverage Requirements

### Critical Healthcare Modules (95%+ Coverage Required)

These modules directly handle patient safety, medication management, and core healthcare operations:

#### 1. API Client (`client/lib/api-client.ts`) - 100% Required
- **Why 100%**: All healthcare data transactions flow through this module
- **Critical Functions**:
  - Authentication header injection
  - Error handling and retry logic
  - Request/response interceptors
  - Timeout and cancellation handling
  - File upload capabilities

#### 2. Medication Service (`client/services/medication.service.ts`) - 95% Required
- **Why Critical**: Patient safety depends on accurate medication management
- **Critical Functions**:
  - Drug interaction checking
  - Allergy cross-referencing
  - Prescription validation
  - Medication adherence tracking
  - Dosage format validation

#### 3. Patient Service (`client/services/patient.service.ts`) - 95% Required
- **Why Critical**: Core patient data management and privacy protection
- **Critical Functions**:
  - Patient data CRUD operations
  - Search and filtering
  - Data validation
  - Privacy compliance
  - Error handling

#### 4. Patient Thresholds Service (`client/services/patientThresholds.service.ts`) - 95% Required
- **Why Critical**: Clinical decision support and alert systems
- **Critical Functions**:
  - Threshold calculations
  - Alert generation
  - Clinical rules engine
  - Data validation

### Essential Healthcare Infrastructure (85%+ Coverage Required)

These modules support healthcare operations and security:

#### 1. Authentication Context (`client/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`) - 90% Required
- **Why Essential**: Healthcare data security and access control
- **Key Functions**:
  - User authentication and authorization
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Permission validation
  - Session management
  - Healthcare role switching

#### 2. Patient Hooks (`client/hooks/api/usePatients.ts`) - 85% Required
- **Why Essential**: Data fetching and state management for patient operations
- **Key Functions**:
  - Query caching and optimization
  - Mutation handling
  - Error state management
  - Loading states
  - Optimistic updates

#### 3. API Hooks (`client/hooks/useApi.ts`) - 85% Required
- **Why Essential**: Generic API interaction patterns
- **Key Functions**:
  - Request state management
  - Error handling
  - Loading indicators
  - Data transformation

#### 4. Utilities (`client/lib/utils.ts`) - 90% Required
- **Why Essential**: Supporting healthcare operations and data formatting
- **Key Functions**:
  - Data validation utilities
  - Format converters
  - Helper functions
  - Type guards

### Supporting Components (80%+ Coverage Recommended)

UI components and pages that interact with healthcare data should maintain good coverage but are not subject to the strictest requirements.

## 🧪 Test Quality Standards

### Healthcare-Specific Test Requirements

1. **Safety-First Testing**
   - Test error conditions extensively
   - Verify fallback behaviors
   - Ensure graceful degradation
   - Test boundary conditions

2. **Data Integrity Testing**
   - Validate all input/output transformations
   - Test data sanitization
   - Verify format validation
   - Test type safety

3. **Security Testing**
   - Test authentication flows
   - Verify authorization checks
   - Test token handling
   - Validate sensitive data protection

4. **Integration Testing**
   - Test API integration points
   - Verify error propagation
   - Test timeout handling
   - Validate retry mechanisms

### Test Structure Requirements

```typescript
describe('Module Name - Healthcare Compliance', () => {
  describe('Critical Path Testing', () => {
    it('should handle primary use case successfully', () => {
      // Test the main functionality
    });

    it('should handle error conditions safely', () => {
      // Test error scenarios with appropriate fallbacks
    });

    it('should validate input data comprehensively', () => {
      // Test all validation rules
    });
  });

  describe('Edge Cases and Boundaries', () => {
    it('should handle edge case X', () => {
      // Test boundary conditions
    });

    it('should handle malformed input gracefully', () => {
      // Test with invalid/corrupted data
    });
  });

  describe('Healthcare Compliance', () => {
    it('should maintain data privacy standards', () => {
      // Test privacy protection
    });

    it('should audit critical operations', () => {
      // Test logging and audit trails
    });
  });
});
```

## 📈 Coverage Monitoring

### Automated Coverage Checks

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**
   ```bash
   # Run coverage check before each commit
   npm run test:coverage
   ```

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   ```bash
   # Fail builds if coverage drops below thresholds
   npm run test:coverage:ci
   ```

3. **Coverage Dashboard**
   ```bash
   # Generate healthcare coverage report
   ./scripts/healthcare-coverage-dashboard.sh
   ```

### Coverage Thresholds Configuration

The following thresholds are enforced in `vitest.config.ts`:

```typescript
thresholds: {
  global: {
    branches: 80,
    functions: 80,
    lines: 80,
    statements: 80,
  },
  // Critical healthcare modules
  'client/services/**': {
    branches: 95,
    functions: 95,
    lines: 95,
    statements: 95,
  },
  'client/lib/api-client.ts': {
    branches: 100,
    functions: 100,
    lines: 100,
    statements: 100,
  },
  // Essential infrastructure
  'client/contexts/**': {
    branches: 90,
    functions: 90,
    lines: 90,
    statements: 90,
  },
  'client/hooks/**': {
    branches: 85,
    functions: 85,
    lines: 85,
    statements: 85,
  },
}
```

## 🚨 Coverage Alerts and Actions

### Immediate Action Required

When coverage falls below critical thresholds:

1. **Stop Development**: Do not merge code that reduces critical module coverage
2. **Investigate**: Identify which functions/lines lost coverage
3. **Add Tests**: Write specific tests for uncovered code paths
4. **Document**: Update this guide if new patterns emerge

### Coverage Regression Prevention

1. **Branch Protection**: Require coverage checks to pass before merge
2. **Pull Request Reviews**: Include coverage impact in code review
3. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for coverage drops
4. **Regular Audits**: Weekly coverage health checks

## 📝 Test Documentation Requirements

### Critical Module Tests Must Include:

1. **Test Plan Documentation**
   ```typescript
   /**
    * Test Plan: Medication Service Drug Interaction Checking
    *
    * Critical Paths:
    * - Major drug interactions (Warfarin + Aspirin)
    * - Contraindicated combinations
    * - API failure fallback behavior
    *
    * Edge Cases:
    * - Empty medication lists
    * - Single medication (no interactions possible)
    * - Malformed API responses
    *
    * Healthcare Compliance:
    * - Safety-first error handling
    * - Comprehensive logging
    * - Fallback to manual review
    */
   ```

2. **Test Case Traceability**
   ```typescript
   it('should detect dangerous drug interactions [HC-001]', async () => {
     // HC-001: Healthcare Compliance Requirement #1
     // Reference to regulatory requirement or safety standard
   });
   ```

3. **Error Scenario Documentation**
   ```typescript
   it('should handle API errors gracefully for patient safety [SAFETY-CRITICAL]', async () => {
     // When drug interaction API fails, system must assume potential interactions
     // to err on the side of caution for patient safety
   });
   ```
