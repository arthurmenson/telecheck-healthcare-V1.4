# Frontend Integration Workstream

**Branch**: `frontend`
**Focus**: React UI integration with production backend APIs

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission

Migrate the existing prototype UI to integrate seamlessly with the new production-grade backend architecture while maintaining the professional design and adding strict TypeScript compliance.

## ðŸ“‹ Critical Issues to Fix from Prototype

### 1. TypeScript Configuration Issues
- **Prototype has loose TypeScript settings** allowing `any` types
- **Missing proper type definitions** for API responses
- **No integration** with backend type definitions
- **Form validation** not connected to backend Zod schemas

### 2. Authentication Integration
- **Basic JWT handling** without proper refresh token support
- **No integration** with new RBAC system
- **Session management** needs to work with new auth middleware
- **Route protection** needs role-based access control

### 3. API Integration Problems
- **Hardcoded API endpoints** instead of proper service layer
- **No error handling** for new backend error formats
- **Missing type safety** for API requests/responses
- **No integration** with new validation schemas

## âœ… Success Criteria

### Type Safety & Integration
- [ ] Zero `any` types in frontend code
- [ ] Complete integration with shared type definitions
- [ ] All API calls properly typed
- [ ] Form validation uses backend Zod schemas

### Authentication & Security
- [ ] JWT refresh token implementation
- [ ] Role-based route protection (Doctor/Admin/Nurse/Patient)
- [ ] Proper session management with auth context
- [ ] Security headers and CSRF protection

### Performance & Quality
- [ ] <2s page load times maintained
- [ ] 90%+ component test coverage
- [ ] Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness maintained

### Backend Integration
- [ ] Complete integration with all 6 backend services
- [ ] Error handling for all API failure scenarios
- [ ] Real-time updates via WebSocket connections
- [ ] Proper loading states and error boundaries

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

```bash
# Switch to frontend workstream
cd workstream/frontend

# Install dependencies (will be created)
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm run dev

# Run component tests
pnpm run test

# Run type checking
pnpm run type-check
```
